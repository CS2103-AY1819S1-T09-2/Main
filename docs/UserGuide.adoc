== Introduction
Welcome to the *Anakin* User Guide!

*Anakin*  was built for those who *want to make heavy use of flashcards without the hassle of managing physical copies*. More importantly, Anakin is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

To get started, head over to <<Quick Start>>!

For a quick review of commands, check out <<Command Summary>>.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Anakin.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your copy of Anakin.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all decks
* **`newdeck`** : creates a new deck.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd deck shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

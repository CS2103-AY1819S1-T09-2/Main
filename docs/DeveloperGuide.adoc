== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

== Design

=== Architecture

=== UI component

=== Logic component



image::AnakinLogicClassDiagram.png[width="700", align="left"]

_Structure of the Logic component_

The 'Logic' component:
****
* exposes functionality through LogicManager
* parses user input
* create commands
* modifies Model
****

The `LogicManager` contains an `AnakinModel`, an `AnakinParser`, and a `CommandHistory`.

When a string input by the user is parsed by `AnakinParser`, it creates a new `AnakinCommand` of the appropriate type with the relevant arguments (based on parser tokens). Each `AnakinCommand` has its own Class. `LogicManager` will call `execute` on the command object. If successful, `LogicManager` will modify `Model` accordingly. Regardless of success, `LogicManager` will update `CommandHistory` with the `CommandResult`.



=== Model component

image::AnakinModelClassDiagram.png[width="900", align="left"]

Structure of the Model Component

The `Model`,

****
* stores Anakin data.
* exposes an unmodifiable ObservableList<Deck> and ObservableList<Card> that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
****

=== Storage component

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Card-level operations

==== Current implementation

Card-level operations are supported in Anakin class:

* Anakin#addCard(Card card) - Add a card to the current deck.
* Anakin#deleteCard(Card card) - Delete a card from the current deck.
* Anakin#updateCard( Card target, Card editedCard) - Update the information of a card inside the current deck.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as: Model#addCard(Card card), Model#deleteCard(Card card), Model#updateCard(Card target, Card editedCard) respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how these operations are executed in Model.

The user executes `newcard q/Hello? a/World` to add a new card with question "Hello?" and answer "World" to the current deck.

****
. The `newcard` command calls Model#addCard(Card card), or ModelManager#addCard.
. ModelManager, which implements Model interface, will call Anakin#addCard method.
. Anakin#addCard will throw DeckNotFoundException if the user is not inside a deck. Otherwise, it will call method UniqueCardList#add(Card toAdd).
. UniqueCardList#add will throw DuplicateCardException if the card already exist in the list. Otherwise, it will add the card to its internal ObservableList<Card>.
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the `newcard` operation works:

==== Design consideration

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Anakin class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in Anakin.
** Cons: Deck class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueCardList is modified. This might result in unexpected behaviors if a card-level command is executed and the person in charge of Deck class assumes that the UniqueCardList is unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Deck class.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places. We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

Deck-level operations are supported in Anakin class:

* Anakin#addDeck(AnakinDeck deck) - Add a deck.
* Anakin#removeDeck(AnakinDeck key) - Delete a deck with specified key.
* Anakin#updateDeck(AnakinDeck target, AnakinDeck editedDeck) - Update the information of a card inside the current deck.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as: Model#addDeck(AnakinDeck deck), Model#deleteDeck(AnakinDeck deck), Model#updateDeck(AnakinDeck target, AnakinDeck editedDeck) respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how these operations are executed in Model.

The user executes `newdeck n/My First Deck` to add a new deck with the name `My First Deck`.

****
. The `newdeck` command calls Model#addDeck(AnakinDeck deck), or ModelManager#addDeck.
. ModelManager, which implements Model interface, will call Anakin#addDeck method.
. Anakin#addDeck will call method addDeck(Card toAdd).
. UniqueDeckList#add will throw DuplicateDeckException if the card already exist in the list. Otherwise, it will add the deck to its internal ObservableList<Deck>.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of deck-level operations together with card level operations.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places. We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

== Design

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::AnakinUIClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckListPanel`,
`CardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `PreviewPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the
abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::AnakinLogicClassDiagram.png[width="700", align="left"]

_Structure of the Logic component_

The 'Logic' component:
****
* exposes functionality through LogicManager
* parses user input
* create commands
* modifies Model
****

The `LogicManager` contains an `AnakinModel`, an `AnakinParser`, and a `CommandHistory`.

When a string input by the user is parsed by `AnakinParser`, it creates a new `AnakinCommand` of the appropriate type with the relevant arguments (based on parser tokens). Each `AnakinCommand` has its own Class. `LogicManager` will call `execute` on the command object. If successful, `LogicManager` will modify `Model` accordingly. Regardless of success, `LogicManager` will update `CommandHistory` with the `CommandResult`.


// tag::modelcomponent[]
=== Model component

image::AnakinModelClassDiagram.png[width="900", align="left"]

Structure of the Model Component

The `Model`,

****
* stores Anakin data.
* provides a Model interface for Logic component to execute all commands
* manipulates the state of Anakin
* manages the interaction, relationship between different objects (Anakin, Card, Deck, ...)
* exposes an unmodifiable ObservableList<Deck> and ObservableList<Card> that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI is bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
****
// end::modelcomponent[]

=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can store `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back
* can save Anakin's data in XML format and read it back

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::cardleveloperation[]
=== Card-level operations

==== Current implementation

Card-level operations are supported in Anakin class:

* Anakin#addCard(Card card) - Add a card to the current deck.
* Anakin#deleteCard(Card card) - Delete a card from the current deck.
* Anakin#updateCard( Card target, Card editedCard) - Update the information of a card inside the current deck.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as: Model#addCard(Card card), Model#deleteCard(Card card), Model#updateCard(Card target, Card editedCard) respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how these operations are executed in Model.

The user executes `newcard q/Hello? a/World` to add a new card with question "Hello?" and answer "World" to the current deck.

****
. The `newcard` command calls Model#addCard(Card card), or ModelManager#addCard.
. ModelManager, which implements Model interface, will call Anakin#addCard method.
. Anakin#addCard will throw DeckNotFoundException if the user is not inside a deck. Otherwise, it will call method UniqueCardList#add(Card toAdd).
. UniqueCardList#add will throw DuplicateCardException if the card already exist in the list. Otherwise, it will add the card to its internal ObservableList<Card>.
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the `newcard` operation works:

image::NewcardSequenceDiagram.png[width="790", align="left"]

==== Design consideration

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Anakin class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in Anakin.
** Cons: Deck class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueCardList is modified. This might result in unexpected behaviors if a card-level command is executed and the person in charge of Deck class assumes that the UniqueCardList is unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Deck class.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places. We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

// end::cardleveloperation[]

=== Deck-level operations

==== Current implementation

Deck-level operations are supported in Anakin class:

* Anakin#addDeck(Deck deck) - Add a deck.
* Anakin#removeDeck(Deck key) - Delete a deck with specified key.
* Anakin#updateDeck(Deck target, Deck editedDeck) - Update the information of a card inside the current deck.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as: Model#addDeck(Deck deck), Model#deleteDeck(Deck deck), Model#updateDeck(Deck target, Deck editedDeck) respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how these operations are executed in Model.

The user executes `newdeck n/My First Deck` to add a new deck with the name `My First Deck`.

****
. The `newdeck` command calls Model#addDeck(Deck deck), or ModelManager#addDeck.
. ModelManager, which implements Model interface, will call Anakin#addDeck method.
. Anakin#addDeck will call method addDeck(Card toAdd).
. UniqueDeckList#add will throw DuplicateDeckException if the card already exist in the list. Otherwise, it will add the deck to its internal ObservableList<Deck>.
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the `newdeck` operation works:

image::NewDeck.png[width="790", align="left"]

==== Design consideration

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of deck-level operations in Anakin class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in Anakin.
** Cons: Deck class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueCardList is modified. This might result in unexpected behaviors if a card-level command is executed and the person in charge of Deck class assumes that the UniqueCardList is unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of deck-level operations together with card level operations.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places. We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

=== Performance Tracking Implementation

==== Current Implementation (v1.3)

The user can assign to a card a difficulty after reviewing it in "play" mode. Users can only do this assignment on
the card they are currently reviewing, as it is the only time it makes sense.

The command available to the user will be `classify [DIFFICULTY_TEXT]`, where `DIFFICULTY_TEXT` is any of the strings
 `easy`, `good`, `hard`, and `review`, corresponding to the respective levels of perceived difficulty of that
 flashcard (`review` refers to flagging for immediate review, and that card will be automatically assigned a
 difficulty of `hard`).

Given below is an example usage scenario for the performance tracking feature.

Step 1. The user requests to "play" a deck. He sees a card A (question only) from the deck.

Step 2. The user requests to see the answer. He sees the answer displayed with the question.

Step 3. The user executes `classify hard`. Card A is now assigned the difficulty of `hard`.

Step 4. The user continues reviewing the rest of the cards in the deck.

Step 5. Card A is shown to the user more regularly when he reviews the same deck in the future.


=== UI implementation

==== Current implementation (v1.2)

The UI for Anakin at v1.2 splits the main area into three sections:

 * (Left) List of decks
 * (Center) List of cards in selected deck
 * (Right) Preview area for the selected card

This was implemented by morphing PersonListPanel and PersonListCard into our use cases for decks and cards and
editing MainWindow to render changes in both decks and cards.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lists are displayed at each step.

Step 1. The user launches Anakin application and sees a list of sample decks. At this step, the CardListPanel is
empty.

Step 2. The user executes `cd 1` command to navigate into the first deck. Anakin renders the deck's cards (at index
1) on the CardListPanel.

Step 3. The user executes `cd 2` command to navigate into the second deck. Anakin switches the displayed cards with
that of the second deck.

Step 4. The user executes `cd ..` command to navigate out of the second deck. The CardListPanel is empty again.

==== Design considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Display deck and card lists side by side

** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Somewhat lacking in aesthetics

* *Alternative 2:* Display deck and card list in the same panel and switch out accordingly

** Pros: Looks more impressive in UI-wise,
** Cons: Have to implement a switch event to toggle items inside StackPane


// tag::keepcardspanelupdatedbyui[]

=== Keep cards panel updated by UI

==== Problem with the old design

The UI (MainWindow) constructs the cards panel by obtaining an `ObservableList` of cards from Model,
this list is assigned when UI starts, and will never be re-assigned.
The UI "observes" the list and updates when it is modified.

This approach works well for the deck list because Anakin contains only 1 list of decks.
However, the card list can not be updated in the same manner because Model component will
change its card list's reference when user enters another deck.

In this case, the card list in UI will not be updated because the card list of which UI has
reference to is actually not changed, but it is the wrong card list.

==== Design considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Have a `displayedCards` list in Model and keep it updated with the current list of cards

** Explanation: The UI needs only 1 reference to this `displayedCards` list, each time user enters another deck,
`displayedCards` list is cleared and the new deck's list of cards is copy to the `displayedCards` list
** Pros: The structure of Model and UI component needs not be changed
** Cons: Need to keep a copy of the current card list, copying the whole list of cards
 for each `cd` operation has bad effect on performance

* *Alternative 2:* Model component raises an event when its current card list's reference is changed

** Explanation: When user `cd` (enters) a new deck, Model will raise
an event (CardListChangedEvent), which is subscribed by UI, then UI can re-assign its list of cards
and update the cards panel accordingly
** Pros: Better performance
** Cons: Need to re-design Model and UI components
// end::keepcardspanelupdatedbyui[]

=== Import/Export Implementation
==== Current implementation (v1.3)

Imports and exports in Anakin are managed by a PortManager.

PortManager will contain a `java.nio Path` that files will be exported to. By default it is the same folder that Anakin is located in.
Exporting a `Deck` will convert it to an `XmlExportableDeck`
Upon creation, Model will initialize a PortManager. When an ExportCommand or ImportCommand is executed, it will call the Model's importDeck or exportDeck method.


==== Design considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Have Model contain a PortManager class to manage imports and export.
** Explanation: Commands pass arguments to Model, which passes arguments to its PortManager.
In the case of ExportCommand, the `Deck` to be exported is passed from Command to Model to PortManager.
PortManager returns a `String` of the export location, which is passed to Model, then passed to the Command for printing. +

** Pros: Better modularity
** Cons: Have to pass messages through many layers and methods.

* *Alternative 2:* Have Model itself manage imports and exports

** Pros: Less message passing between layers
** Cons: Worse modularity and Separation of Concerns.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

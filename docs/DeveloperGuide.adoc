== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

== Design

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::AnakinUIClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckListPanel`,
`CardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `PreviewPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the
abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::AnakinLogicClassDiagram.png[width="700", align="left"]

_Structure of the Logic component_

The 'Logic' component:
****
* exposes functionality through LogicManager
* parses user input
* create commands
* modifies Model
****

The `LogicManager` contains an `AnakinModel`, an `AnakinParser`, and a `CommandHistory`.

When a string input by the user is parsed by `AnakinParser`, it creates a new `AnakinCommand` of the appropriate type with the relevant arguments (based on parser tokens). Each `AnakinCommand` has its own Class. `LogicManager` will call `execute` on the command object. If successful, `LogicManager` will modify `Model` accordingly. Regardless of success, `LogicManager` will update `CommandHistory` with the `CommandResult`.



=== Model component

image::AnakinModelClassDiagram.png[width="900", align="left"]

Structure of the Model Component

The `Model`,

****
* stores Anakin data.
* exposes an unmodifiable ObservableList<Deck> and ObservableList<Card> that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
****

=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AnakinStorage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can store `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back
* can save Anakin's data in XML format and read it back

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Card-level operations

==== Current implementation

Card-level operations are supported in Anakin class:

* Anakin#addCard(Card card) - Add a card to the current deck.
* Anakin#deleteCard(Card card) - Delete a card from the current deck.
* Anakin#updateCard( Card target, Card editedCard) - Update the information of a card inside the current deck.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as: Model#addCard(Card card), Model#deleteCard(Card card), Model#updateCard(Card target, Card editedCard) respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how these operations are executed in Model.

The user executes `newcard q/Hello? a/World` to add a new card with question "Hello?" and answer "World" to the current deck.

****
. The `newcard` command calls Model#addCard(Card card), or ModelManager#addCard.
. ModelManager, which implements Model interface, will call Anakin#addCard method.
. Anakin#addCard will throw DeckNotFoundException if the user is not inside a deck. Otherwise, it will call method UniqueCardList#add(Card toAdd).
. UniqueCardList#add will throw DuplicateCardException if the card already exist in the list. Otherwise, it will add the card to its internal ObservableList<Card>.
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the `newcard` operation works:

image::NewCard sequence diagram.png[width="790", align="left"]

==== Design consideration

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Anakin class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in Anakin.
** Cons: Deck class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueCardList is modified. This might result in unexpected behaviors if a card-level command is executed and the person in charge of Deck class assumes that the UniqueCardList is unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Deck class.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places. We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

=== Deck-level operations

==== Current implementation

Deck-level operations are supported in Anakin class:

* Anakin#addDeck(AnakinDeck deck) - Add a deck.
* Anakin#removeDeck(AnakinDeck key) - Delete a deck with specified key.
* Anakin#updateDeck(AnakinDeck target, AnakinDeck editedDeck) - Update the information of a card inside the current deck.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as: Model#addDeck(AnakinDeck deck), Model#deleteDeck(AnakinDeck deck), Model#updateDeck(AnakinDeck target, AnakinDeck editedDeck) respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how these operations are executed in Model.

The user executes `newdeck n/My First Deck` to add a new deck with the name `My First Deck`.

****
. The `newdeck` command calls Model#addDeck(AnakinDeck deck), or ModelManager#addDeck.
. ModelManager, which implements Model interface, will call Anakin#addDeck method.
. Anakin#addDeck will call method addDeck(Card toAdd).
. UniqueDeckList#add will throw DuplicateDeckException if the card already exist in the list. Otherwise, it will add the deck to its internal ObservableList<Deck>.
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the `newdeck` operation works:

image::NewDeck.png[width="790", align="left"]

==== Design consideration

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of deck-level operations in Anakin class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in Anakin.
** Cons: Deck class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueCardList is modified. This might result in unexpected behaviors if a card-level command is executed and the person in charge of Deck class assumes that the UniqueCardList is unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of deck-level operations together with card level operations.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places. We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

=== Performance Tracking Implementation

==== Proposed Implementation (v1.3)

The user can assign to a card a difficulty after reviewing it in "play" mode. Users can only do this assignment on
the card they are currently reviewing, as it is the only time it makes sense.

The command available to the user will be `classify [DIFFICULTY_TEXT]`, where `DIFFICULTY_TEXT` is any of the strings
 `easy`, `good`, `hard`, and `review`, corresponding to the respective levels of perceived difficulty of that
 flashcard (`review` refers to flagging for immediate review, and that card will be automatically assigned a
 difficulty of `hard`).

Given below is an example usage scenario for the performance tracking feature.

Step 1. The user requests to "play" a deck. He sees a card A (question only) from the deck.

Step 2. The user requests to see the answer. He sees the answer displayed with the question.

Step 3. The user executes `classify hard`. Card A is now assigned the difficulty of `hard`.

Step 4. The user continues reviewing the rest of the cards in the deck.

Step 5. Card A is shown to the user more regularly when he reviews the same deck in the future.


=== UI implementation

==== Current implementation (v1.2)

The UI for Anakin at v1.2 splits the main area into three sections:

 * (Left) List of decks
 * (Center) List of cards in selected deck
 * (Right) Preview area for the selected card

This was implemented by morphing PersonListPanel and PersonListCard into our use cases for decks and cards and
editing MainWindow to render changes in both decks and cards.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lists are displayed at each step.

Step 1. The user launches Anakin application and sees a list of sample decks. At this step, the CardListPanel is
empty.

Step 2. The user executes `cd 1` command to navigate into the first deck. Anakin renders the deck's cards (at index
1) on the CardListPanel.

Step 3. The user executes `cd 2` command to navigate into the second deck. Anakin switches the displayed cards with
that of the second deck.

Step 4. The user executes `cd ..` command to navigate out of the second deck. The CardListPanel is empty again.

==== Design considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Display deck and card lists side by side

** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Somewhat lacking in aesthetics

* *Alternative 2:* Display deck and card list in the same panel and switch out accordingly

** Pros: Looks more impressive in UI-wise,
** Cons: Have to implement a switch event to toggle items inside StackPane

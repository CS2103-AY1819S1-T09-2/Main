== PROJECT: Anakin

---

== Overview
Anakin is a desktop  application built to help people memorize things better by providing
digital flash cards.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancements:*
** *Re-design and implement the model component*

*** What can the new model do:

**** Allows Anakin to have a unique list of decks, each deck contains a unique list of cards.
**** Allows UI to observe both the deck list and card list so that it can update its deck panel and
card panel when user execute different commands.
**** Allows Logic component to execute its set of commands by providing a complete Model interface,
which can support those operations.

*** Justification: The new model component executes the logic of all commands, determines
 how objects like deck and card interacts with each other and
 manipulate the state of the application.

** *Implement `find` command*

*** What can `find` command do:
**** Search for decks by name if user is under the home directory.
**** Search for cards by question if user is inside a deck.

*** Justification: This allows user to locate the deck or card that contains specific keywords
 quickly when the application has a lot of data.

* *Minor enhancements:*

** *Implement `sort` command*

*** What can `sort` command do:
**** Sort the current deck list in lexicographical order.
**** Sort the current card list in lexicographical order if user is inside a deck.

*** Justification: This allows user to manage their data better and to find
 deck or card easily.

 ** *Implement `newdeck` command*
